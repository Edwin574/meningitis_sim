## Agent-Based Modeling: Mock solution

This is an implementation of an`Agent-Based Model` using `messa` Python package.
We implement a **SIR**-like  model. Cab be exrended to:

    - Susceptible
    - Exposed 
    - Infected

    - etc
  

Attempted to make a `UI`, to set model parameters with minimum effort.
